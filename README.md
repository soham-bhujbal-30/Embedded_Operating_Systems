# EOS - Operating System Concepts in C 🖥️🐧

Welcome to the **EOS** repository! This project contains a collection of C programs demonstrating key Operating System concepts and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms. It is designed as an educational resource to help you learn and practice OS fundamentals through hands-on coding examples.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 **Assignments** covering various OS topics.
- 🔄 **Process Management:** Demonstrations of process creation using `fork()`.
- 🔗 **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**
  - Named Pipes (FIFOs)
  - Unnamed Pipes
  - Message Queues
  - Shared Memory
  - Sockets
- 🧵 **Multithreading:** Examples using POSIX threads (`pthread`).
- ⚙️ **Signal Handling:** Programs illustrating signal processing.
- 📄 **Documentation:** Includes assignment PDFs for guided learning.
